# EMLAR XXI 2025 - Computational Modelling in Python: Distributional Semantic Models

Meaghan Fowlie, Utrecht University

Materials adapted from Raquel G. Alhama and Andrew Jessop

Here are the materials for a tutorial at [Experimental Methods in Language Acquisition Research 2025 workshop](https://emlar.wp.hum.uu.nl/tutorial/computational-modeling/). 

The code for this tutorial can be found in the `EMLAR2025.ipynb` jupyter notebook, and the data in the `data` folder. 

We recommend you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) distribution of Python before the start of the tutorial.

This tutorial is target at researchers who are interested in computational modelling but have little to no experience with modelling and/or Distributional Semantic Models.

## Tutorial overview

Computational models are an increasingly important tool in linguistics. They can help us formalize a learning problem, explain data from behavioral experiments and  --perhaps most intriguingly-- can simulate proposed mechanisms of the child's mind. On a practical level, computational experiments do not suffer the same constraints as child studies, so we can explore more experimental conditions.

This tutorial will offer a brief general introduction to modeling followed by a joint programming session. Participants will get hands-on experience with the use of the programming language Python, a high level programming language that is approachable for beginners, while at the same time it is useful for advanced scientific computing. At the end of the tutorial, participants will have built a working model and thus gained insight into the possibilities and limitations of computational modeling in language research.
